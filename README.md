# FastChat-CS251
In this project we create a fast, secure and scalable chat application.
The aim of our project was:
- To obtain **high throughput** with limited resources dedicated for the servers
- To ensure **low latency** of individual message deliveries
- To have **E2E encryption** between clients
- To have a **robust** application that can prevent password retrieval attacks
<br>
We have used the User Diagram Protocol (UDP) for communication between the clients and the servers.
We have used Sqlite3 for the databasing of out project
Our Database consists of User Info, Messages, Group Tables.
We have implemented the Round Robin and the Random Allocation load balancing methods.
